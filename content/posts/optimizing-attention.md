+++

This post takes you from understanding attention to deploying it at production scale. We'll start with the mathematics and a basic implementation. Then we'll explore the key innovations that enable production systems to serve thousands of users simultaneously at speed.

## What You'll Learn
We'll start from first principles. You'll understand the attention mechanism mathematically, implement multi-head attention, then progressively optimize it.


[Part I - Attention mathematics and implementation](#part-i---attention-mathematics-and-implementation)

[Part II - Optimizing for speed with FlashAttention](#part-ii---optimizing-for-speed-with-flashattention)

[Part III - Optimizing for memory with GQA](#part-iii---optimizing-for-memory-with-gqa)

[Part IV - Optimizing for throughput with PagedAttention](#part-iv---optimizing-for-throughput-with-pagedattention)

[Part V - Production deployment with vLLM](#part-v---production-deployment-with-vllm)

Each section profiles the current implementation, identifies the bottleneck, and builds the solution from scratch. By the end, you'll understand both the theory and the production engineering of attention.

Let's begin.
